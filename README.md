## Mission
Want to carve out some creative code time where you can work on your projects without anybody looking over your shoulder or wondering when you'll be finished with that feature? Or maybe there's a language or technology that you've really wanted to try but haven't found the time to do it! 

Do yourself a favor and come out to Code & Coffee where you can sit down and code to your heart's content on whatever project you bring! Whatever the language and level, show up.

_MUST HAVE: An upbeat positive attitude and have zero tolerance for stereotypes._

This meetup does not accept project proposals and we are not a recruiting event.

Come join us on Slack! We have a [_#code-and-coffee_](https://yvrdev.slack.com/messages/code-and-coffee/) room on _Vancouver Developers_!
